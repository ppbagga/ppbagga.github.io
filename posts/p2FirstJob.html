<p>So, for people who don’t know, my university has this very unique program called co-op. Basically, before even entering the industry, all the engineering students will have two years of experience working for six different companies in their respective field. At present, I am on my very first four month co-op term.
</p>
<p>Earlier this entire process was really fascinating for me. In India, you will rarely see an 18 year old kid holding his resume and waiting in queue for an interview. They might rather prefer a Justin Beiber’s lip synced concert, if you know what I mean. Over here, the scenario is completely different.
</p>
<p>The job application process starts right at the beginning of the term before co-op. This means that you have roughly four months to polish your skills, update your resume and enter the rat race. To be honest, I didn’t have a job until my final exams and I wasn’t sure if at all I will be working this summer. I started mailing a whole lot of professors and startups with a good looking cover letter and an impressive resume. But I think I was a bit late. I received replies from 75% of them which is around 300 mails, but all I could see was “Sorry, I have already hired co-ops for this term. Good luck on your search”. I wasn’t surprised, because yes I was late, very late. Also, I cannot sit doing nothing and so I turned on Netflix. Yeah, at that point Riverdale helped me. This one thing added thrill and excitement to my life. Thinking about how Jason Blossom might have been killed, became more important to me.
</p>
<p>Two days later, I received a reply from Curiato Inc., a startup based in Waterloo. They are working on a smart mattress to prevent pressure injury diseases (or bedsores). They said,
</p>
<p>“Hello Prashant,
</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest and CV, you messaged us in time, we are hiring! Please list some available times for next week, including your number,  where we may schedule a telephone interview. It will approximately take 15 minutes.
</p>
<p>Best regards,
</p>
<p>The Curiato Team”
</p>
<p>Phew…that night I slept for 12 hours. A week later, I got the phone interview cleared, it was much him talking about what they want and how I could be of any help to them. Now, it was time for an actual interview, on May 1st. If I don’t get this one, I would be left with nothing. However, my employer turned out to be a generous person. He was frank, he said that he needs me, but they don’t have enough funds. I was back again in the situation like the last 15 minutes of my Calculus exam, you have to score high, you have some time, but you don’t know HOW. I should say, the best deal is to leave, and be satisfied with what you get. So, I had to seal the deal with a decent amount of pay and yes I am happily EMPLOYED now..!
</p>
<p>I realized that Curiato is still at its early stage of development. I am right now working on their (I should say our) first prototype which looked horrible to me at first. In order to showcase my art skills and show them how creative I can be, for a moment I forgot that I was an engineering student and became an artsy guy. I made our prototype look really dope and bunched all those tangling bunch of wires together. I assume they were really happy. We still have a year before we show our final product to the world. This gives me a lot of freedom on my job, because we can take risks, we can try things differently, and we can go beyond the conventional thinking.
</p>
<p>Its been a week at the job and I think that the startup environment has been a really amazing experience for me. From soldering our pressure sensors, making the design of  our PCB board to doing international calls for vendors, I am trying all the variety of skills I could develop on. The only thing that keeps me going is the freedom. Its not like the engineering jobs at big companies where you repeat the same thing each and every day. A data scientist will only analyse the statistics, a software engineer will only work on the algorithm, a hardware engineer will only work on circuits, an IT guy will only troubleshoot your network or PC, a sales guy will only request quotes, but….. I do all of them on the very same day.
</p>
<p>The place where Curiato is based is called Velocity Garage. Velocity is a prominent incubator associated with the University of Waterloo. They encourage students to bring their idea, build their own startup, fund them and even give them place for continuing  their operations. They act like your dad, also the moment they find you are ready to face the world alone, they will abandon you only after throwing a huge party. So, along with my team we have 150 other startups working day and night without any 9-5 rule to make our dream a reality.
</p>
<p>I am really happy, I landed up getting a job with this startup. As it is said, all you need to do is take an INITIATIVE..!
</p>
<p>Cheers
