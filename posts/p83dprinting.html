You might have heard about incidents of a heart failure, kidney failure, or maybe a brain, but I’m sure a couple of decades later, no one will ever die of an organ failure. The moment you realise your heart isn’t working, just turn on your 3D printer, wait….wait…wait (it takes pretty long) and get yourself a replacement. Wow, that was smooth, surely 3D printing has been evolving at a higher pace than an iPhone.

First and foremost, a model of an organ is made using the common technologies such as CT scan and MRI. To print with a layer by layer approach, this model is cut into many layers horizontally before being sent to the printer. Prior to printing, it’s important to understand the micro-environment, the nature of biological forces that exist in our body as well as the precise organisation of a cell. Imagine how difficult it would be to use some inanimate fluids and materials to make that artificial heart pump.

You might be wondering what kind of material do they use to make a living organ, lets have a look. 3D bioprinting utilizes the layer-by-layer method to deposit materials known as Bioinks, to create tissue-like structures. These bioinks are derived from natural polymers such as gelatin. To make bio-ink, scientists create a slurry of cells that can be loaded into a cartridge and inserted into a specially designed printer, along with another cartridge containing a gel known as bio-paper. Bio-paper is a special liquefied material that provides oxygen and other nutrients to the cells to keep them alive.

The post-bioprinting process is make sure a stable structure is created from the biological material. To maintain the object, both mechanical and chemical stimulations are needed. These stimulations send signal to the cells to control the growth of tissues. It is important to keep those cells proliferating.

Essentially what I learn from this article is that this technology is gonna hit hard on people who were planning to sell their kidney for an iPhone, because now we can MASS PRODUCE them.
