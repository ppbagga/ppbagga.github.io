<p>Where on one side of the world, people are facing problems like poverty and food shortages, the first world countries have their own set of problems. One of them, is the continuously draining battery of the device, that our hands cannot resist. Honestly, people are now obsessed with their phones and we always want our devices to be fully charged. There should be no break to our never ending conversations or facebook posts or maybe Netflix.
</p>
<p>Humans tend to become lazy and there’s no harm, its perfectly fine if your phone’s battery runs out. But what will happen a decade later, when you are all set for a party you get your keys, sit in your car and find that your electric car’s battery is dead. Sad but yes, we will surely enter the era of self-driving and electric cars. All the big brands are right now in their own league, putting tons of effort in developing a unique technology to take this dream to another level. Qualcomm, the silicon manufacturer, is one of them.
</p>
<p>All this build up, was to tell you that Qualcomm has demonstrated this amazing technology where you could now charge your electric car while driving. This will in turn help accelerate the adoption of self-driving cars. The charging technology witnessed a rapid advancement recently, from fast charging to wireless, and now dynamic charging. This dynamic charging test, took place at a test track in France using two Renault Kangoo vehicles (electric cars). Looking at the situation, the exact information is being kept top secret and that’s all know they announced.
</p>
<p>Experts believe that self-driving cars of tomorrow will be electric and require a way to charge themselves without human intervention. Electric vehicle charging is one area where Qualcomm could grow as it strives to reduce its dependence on a cold smartphone market. Qualcomm’s Chief Executive has also called automotive technology and Internet of Things a “tremendous opportunity” for the company.
</p>
<p>Be excited, next 10 years of your life seems pretty interesting.
</p>
<p>Cheers.
