<p>I would never forget the Samsung Note 7 battery explosion fiasco. That series of fires, recalls and cancellation lasted for around eight months and caused Samsung a $10 billion hit by the end of it. The entire tech industry learnt a very big lesson that day : don’t play with your batteries. So to resolve this, researchers at the Stanford University thought, why not put an end to the presence of a battery itself..!
</p>
<p>Specifically for electronic medical implants, such as pacemakers, there often isn’t room for a big power pack inside the human body. Therefore, these researchers developed a way to wirelessly charge the devices implanted inside the human body. The concept is similar to  Samsung’s wireless charger, that uses a coil to create an electromagnetic field. A corresponding coil in the implant collects energy from the field, which induces a current and powers the device. These waves, however cannot pass through our tissues. Otherwise, they could have simply used Samsung’s charger.
</p>
<p>“Implants like cochlear implants (inside ear) are used for surgeries, but the power source itself has to be fairly large and the implant has to be very shallow. They can’t reach the important places in the body, like the heart or the brain.” explains a research student. Definitely, our ears don’t have enough space to hold a power bank. In order to power wirelessly, they aimed to transport energy through the biological tissues. But we know you can’t, because our tissues won’t let waves enter our body.
</p>
<p>This team consequently found a method to manipulate the waves, so that they propagate and pass through live tissue. The power source lying outside, will always generate electromagnetic waves of a specific pattern. As the wave hit and interact with live tissue, they convert into a new type of wave, called “mid-field.” and now these mid-field waves are used to power the implant. They were able to charge their implant successfully and got their research patented. This implant is part of, a class of medical therapies known as “electroceuticals.”
</p>
<p>It will be several years before such a system will reach consumer medical devices. But the stage for a new era of electronic medicine, has certainly been set.
