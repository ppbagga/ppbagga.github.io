<p>“It is sometimes so difficult to put into words”, that’s the agony of a cancer patient but no, not any more. Three MIT professors are innovating at the tiniest possible scale, to develop tools to see, target and kill cancer cells even before they can cause any harm.
</p>
<p>Cancer has been a prominent area of research among all the nanotechnology scientists, for a long time now. It’s simply because when you can’t think big, why not try small. There are some nanomaterials, known to be emitting out really interesting light. Now we know these tiny interesting materials can surely light our path. Yes, these professors engineered them to be able to look deeply inside our body.
</p>
<p>CT scans can find tumors with an accuracy of a centimeter. Using these nanomaterials, we can now spot tumors as small as half a millimeter…! If you can start finding tumors that are in the millimeter range, you can catch them much earlier, and if patients are diagnosed in stage 1 or stage 2 of cancer, they have a very good survival rate. So, this was part one.
</p>
<p>Now, we need nanomaterials to cause destruction, I mean to kill cancer cells. The catch is, you do not want the healthy cells to be disturbed. This team designed nanoparticles that are built in layers. Essentially, the outer layer sits and binds on a tumor cell using a molecular zip code. This allow those nanoparticles to only attack on infected cells. Then, there’s a middle layer that can alter the genetics of the tumour cell, to compensate for its resistance to chemotherapy. Finally, at the core is a drug that kills the weakened tumor cell without affecting the healthy cells around it.
</p>
<p>If there is a tumor cell that is resistant to chemotherapy, then you first are releasing something that is going to block that mode of resistance, and then releasing the chemotherapy drug afterward. Amazing, first take control over your enemy, destroy his shield and now, play offensive. That’s how we roll.
</p>
<p>Have a good day !
