If you are an Android user, you can easily relate to this problem. Currently, your mobile device might be working on Jelly Bean, Lollipop, Marshmallow or if you are lucky enough, maybe Nougat. Its been roughly eight months since Android Nougat (the latest version) hit the market. But, when you look at the statistics, its pretty depressing. Only 7% of the total Android market have the privilege to use Nougat at present. Why so? Don’t you think that’s weird. Why aren’t companies like Samsung and Motorola not sending us updates quick enough?

The answer is because  processing a software update is time consuming as well as costly. There are several steps a new Android release goes through before getting into the hands of users. First of all, this Android on its own is not a complete phone operating system. To get Android to do anything, you need support from Qualcomm, Samsung, and every other company who makes the mobile processors and chip sets. The software that make these parts work is separate. Microprocessors need to be built into Android’s code, to complete the operating system. Each time Android is updated, whether it be a full platform update, like the jump from Marshmallow to Nougat or simply a security update, the parts that make the hardware work, needs to change.

Basically, this is what we need to improve. It slows things down considerably. Instead of Google being able to send a single update for every phone, they send a non-complete operating system that needs the rest to be built on the new base. Later, this also needs to be compiled and tested. This was the role of silicon manufacturers. Now, the same specific modifications are made by Android device makers and carriers. Only after they test and certify the new release, you see that pop up in your phone. IT’S TIME FOR AN UPDATE…!

With the release of Android O later this year, Google is planning to restructure Android to make it easier, faster and less costly for manufacturers to update devices to a newer version. This is also known as Project Treble. The core concept is to separate the vendor implementation from the Android OS Framework. Vendor Implementation is the device-specific, lower-level software written by the silicon manufacturers. For example, Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835, has its software written for Samsung S8 with Android Nougat. This software will have to change when Android O arrives, because they made it specific for a particular device and a particular platform.

Project Treble solved this issue by the introduction of a new vendor interface between the Android OS framework and the vendor implementation. With a stable vendor interface providing access to the hardware-specific parts of Android, device makers can choose to deliver a new Android release to consumers by just updating the Android OS framework, without any additional work required from the silicon manufacturers.

As of now, Project Treble will be coming to all new devices launched with Android O and beyond.
