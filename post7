Apple was always know to acquire AI (Artificial Intelligence) based startups to boost the  significance of Siri. This time, Lattice Data was on its shopping list, and this acquisition ended up in a $200 million deal. Lattice Data Inc. is a specialist in using machine learning to analyze  “dark data” efficiently. I saw a lot of people talking about “dark data” over the internet, but no one actually explained what this term refers to.

While reading some books and referring to some professors, I realized it’s really difficult to explain. “Dark data” has a lot of aspects to it. I will put this into simple words for you. We are surrounded by a variety sensors in this world. There are temperature sensors, humidity sensors, pressure sensors, IR (infrared) sensors, proximity sensors, touch sensors and so on..their job is to detect any change in their environment, and send that information to a processor. Now the question is, do you think all the data generated by this sensor is getting used ? No, not at all.  It is estimated that most companies are only analyzing 1% of the data generated by their system. Thus, all the 99% of data that they don’t care about falls under this category called “dark data”.

But, but, but..all these companies will still store that dark data for regulatory compliance and record keeping. Some organizations believe that dark data could be useful to them in the future, once they have acquired better analytic and business intelligence technology to process the information. Actually, they are waiting for startups like Lattice data to do this job and then you know…Apple got billions in their account.

I think Apple is playing really smart. To retain its monopoly, it just buys every single startup that has the potential to turn BIG.
