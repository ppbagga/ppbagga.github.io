        <h3 class="header">Here's an Intro</h3>
        
       <p class="intro">Greetings..!</p>

       <p class="intro">I am Prashant Bagga, a Nanotechnology Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, Canada. Basically, I am an international student from India. That’s all; here I end my formal introduction. Now, lets start with why I am here.
       </p>
       <p class="intro">I would like to share with you why I started this series of blogs. There comes a time in everybody’s life, when you have a question for every single thing you observe. Right here, at this very point you will see two kinds of homo sapiens. The first one, who think they are smart enough, will take this observation as a nature’s law and will always believe that this was supposed to happen. Then we see the other kind, they are tremendously amazed by what their eyes just saw. They will be very confused. They will try to dig in, why did that happen. These people as your intuition says, will SET that nature’s law. This is a very simple to understand reality. Its all about how you perceive.
       </p>
       <p class="intro">Now, why did I discuss about those two kinds of people. Sometimes, knowledge presented in a very complex way can demotivate you from understanding it. It can be a lecture from your 60-year-old professor or simply a supercomputer lying in front of your eyes. It happens a lot with me. I happened to see a lot of fascinating stuff after I entered university. But sometimes, when you are bombarded with that evil tech jargon, I kind of refrain from digging deep into it.
       </p>
       <p class="intro">Being A Technocrat will come up with whole lot of content. I call them 'Tech Talks'. My language would be like having a 5 minute conversation with you.  I will be posting blogs of the latest research and progress in the tech world. I am keen to hear your feedback and suggestions, as well as guest post submissions are obviously more than welcome!
       </p>
       <p class="intro">Last but not the least, welcome to my world!
       </p>
       <p class="intro">So let's dive right in and start off with our first post.
       </p>
       <p class="intro">Cheers
       </p>
